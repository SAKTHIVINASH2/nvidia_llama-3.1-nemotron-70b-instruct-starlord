# NVIDIA_Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-Starlord

## Overview
This repository contains a Streamlit-based Python application that utilizes the NVIDIA Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-Starlord model via API integration. The application allows users to generate content such as text and code based on their input queries. The underlying API is powered by OpenAI, and users provide their API keys directly in the app.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- **Content Generation**: Supports generation of both text and code.
- **Customizable**: Users can input their own OpenAI API key within the app.
- **Real-time Processing**: Instantaneous response to user queries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SAKTHIVINASH2/nvidia_llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct-starlord.git
    cd nvidia_llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct-starlord
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter your OpenAI API key in the provided input field.

4. Input a question or prompt to generate text or code.

## Steps to Get an API Key from NVIDIA
1. **Create an NVIDIA Developer Account**: Go to [NVIDIA Developer's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/). Sign up or log in.
2. **Access NVIDIA's Cloud AI Services**: Once logged in, navigate to the [NVIDIA Cloud page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cloud/).
3. **Find the API Access Section**: Look for the API section for models like LLaMA or similar in the "Generative AI" or "NLP" tools category.
4. **Request Access (if needed)**: Some APIs may require joining a waitlist or submitting a request form to get access.
5. **Get the API Key**: Once granted access, you'll receive an API key for authentication in your requests.

## Example
After starting the app, you can:
- Input prompts like "Write a Python function for bubble sort" to generate code.
- Ask for explanations such as "What is the use of a transformer model?" to get detailed text responses.
